# enhancement

- fix footer layout
- fix zoom component on portfolio page

I have sizes of image and container and image/container proportions.
I need to set container height based on it width and height proportion.
Then get the indicative side.
If indicative is width:
  I have fixed width of container and unknown height of it.
  I need to find width/height proportion of image and apply it to define container height
